# Interactive 3D Portfolio Website

A visually captivating 3D portfolio built with React.js and Three.js! Combines interactive 3D graphics and smooth web performance to showcase my skills in an engaging way.

The Process:

Pick an existing or new folder on your computer and open it in VS Code. In the Source Control view, select the `Initialize Repository` button. This creates a new Git repository in the current folder, allowing you to start tracking code changes. This action is equivalent to running `git init` on the command-line.

`Ctrl + ~` opens your integrated terminal.

Run `npm create vite@latest ./` to create the Vite application in the current folder.

Input `y` to okay the package installation.

Ignore files and continue.

Choose `React`.

Choose `JavaScript`.

Run `npm install`.

Run `npm run dev`.

Open [localhost 5173](http://localhost:5173/) to see the application running locally.

Delete `assets` folder, `App.css`, and `App.jsx`.

Clear all code from `index.css`.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
